# OMOP HOI: GI Ulcer Hospitalization 2 (5000001002)
# - Occurrence of GI Ulcer diagnostic code
# - Hospitalization at time of diagnostic code
# - At least one diagnostic procedure during same hospitalization
# We use the fact that conditions, observations, and procedures all can be tied to a
# visit_occurrence to find situations where the appropriate conditions, diagnostic procedures, and
# place of service all occur in the same visit_occurrence
